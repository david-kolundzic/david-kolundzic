# 👋 Hi, I'm David Kolundžić

🚀 Frontend Developer with a passion for building modular and scalable web applications.  
💡 Working primarily with **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **RxJS**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **SCSS**, while exploring **Angular Signals**, **Storybook**, and component architecture.  
🎯 Currently building a **business dashboard app**, a **UI component library**, and contributing to both public-facing and internal tools at my company.

## 🧰 Full-stack Experience (.NET)

Previously worked on enterprise-grade web applications using **ASP.NET MVC (v5)** with **Razor view engine**, focusing on:

- Templated UI development using `Layouts`, `Partial Views`, and strongly typed `ViewModels`  
- Backend logic in **C#**, data access via **Entity Framework** and **LINQ**  
- Authenticated systems with MVC routing, validation and form handling  
- Clean separation of concerns and reusable component design

These backend skills still shape my frontend mindset, especially in how I structure and scale Angular projects today.

## 🏢 Real-World Projects

### 🌐 bathroombrands.com – Official Company Website

As part of my role at **Bathroom Brands IT**, I developed the company's official landing page  
🔗 [bathroombrands.com](https://bathroombrands.com),  
in close collaboration with the **marketing and design teams** to align the implementation with brand identity and user expectations.


- Built entirely as a **static Angular application**, optimized for speed, responsiveness and clarity  
- Implemented a modern layout with brand showcases and smooth **hover-based dropdown navigation**  
- Focused on accessibility and semantic structure  
- Collaborated closely with stakeholders and brand managers  
- Ensured fast load performance and SEO-friendly structure

### 🛠 Internal Business Application (Intranet)

Alongside public-facing projects, I’m also actively working on the company’s **internal business application** (not publicly accessible).  

- 👨‍💻 Lead frontend developer using **Angular + RxJS + SCSS**  
- 🧠 Implementing dashboards, forms, filtering interfaces and data grids  
- 🔄 Integrated frontend with .NET MVC backend (C#, EF, REST APIs)  
- 🛡️ Authenticated system for internal users only — enterprise-focused

> *Due to confidentiality, this project is not publicly available, but demonstrates my full-stack experience in a real production environment.*
