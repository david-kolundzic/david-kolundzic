## ðŸ§° Full-stack Experience (.NET)

Previously worked on enterprise-grade web applications using **ASP.NET MVC (v5)** with **Razor view engine**, focusing on:

- Clean templating with `Layouts`, `Partial Views` and strongly typed `ViewModels`
- Backend logic in **C#**, with data access via **Entity Framework** and **LINQ**
- Authentication, form validation, and MVC routing
- Templated UIs and reusable UI blocks (Razor components)

These projects helped shape my architectural thinking, and still influence how I structure and scale Angular applications today.
