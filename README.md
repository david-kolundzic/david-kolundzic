- Clean templating using `Layouts`, `Partial Views`, and strongly typed `ViewModels`
- Backend logic in **C#**, with data access via **Entity Framework** and **LINQ**

- Building modular and reusable Razor-based UI blocks

This experience has shaped the way I design scalable and maintainable frontend architectures in Angular today.
